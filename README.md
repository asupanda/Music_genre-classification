# Music_genre-classification
This project delves into music genre classification using machine learning techniques and the GTZAN dataset. By employing advanced algorithms, we've crafted a robust system capable of accurately categorizing audio tracks into their respective genres. The process begins with meticulous feature extraction, where we leverage the power of machine learning to capture the distinct characteristics of each piece of music. This feature extraction phase is crucial, as it lays the foundation for our subsequent modeling efforts. We meticulously preprocessed the dataset on Kaggle notebooks, ensuring its integrity and quality for subsequent analysis.

Moving to the modeling stage, we trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the preprocessed dataset. SVMs are renowned for their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data like audio features, and our implementation yielded promising results. However, to further boost accuracy and robustness, we introduced a stacked ensemble approach, incorporating the formidable XGBoost algorithm. This hybrid model not only enhanced accuracy but also provided a more resilient classification framework, capable of handling a wide variety of music styles and nuances.

One of the highlights of this project is its deployment via Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. This deployment enables users to interact with the model through a user-friendly web interface, making music genre classification accessible to a wider audience. Whether you're an enthusiast exploring diverse music genres or a researcher studying computational musicology, our application provides a convenient platform for genre classification.

This project also serves as a testament to academic achievement, submitted as part of the fulfillment for the MCA course at NIST university,Odisha. It embodies the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios, showcasing the integration of theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience. Through this endeavor, we aim to contribute to the growing field of music informatics while providing a valuable learning resource for students and enthusiasts alike.
